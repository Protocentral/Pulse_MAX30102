Game AI has undergone a quiet revolution in the past few years. No longer is it something that most developers consider only towards the end of a project when shipping deadlines loom and the publisher is pushing to have the game ship before the next holiday milestone. Now game AI is something that is planned for, soemthing that developers are deliberately making as important a part of a game's development as the graphics or the sound effects. The market is rife with games of all kinds and developers are looking for every edge they can get to get the game noticed.
