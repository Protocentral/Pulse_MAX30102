V4.0 (23)
Major update for Processing V3, it will not work with previous versions of Processing.

GPassord control no longer supports horizontal scroll bars, it didn't make sense use max password size instead. 

GTextField and GTextArea the deprecated methods setDefaultText and getDefaultText have been removed use set/getPromptText instead.

No longer possible to create 'undecorated' frames.


V3.5.4 (22)
This is the last version of G4P to be compatible with Processing 2. All future versions will be for Processing 3. The source code is the same as 3.5.3 the changes are so that G4P plays nicely with PS3.

Bug fixes errors when using GLabel in GWindow controls with GUI Builder

V3.5.2 (20)
Bug fixes for GTextField and GTextArea controls. My thanks to kowalski5233 for not only finding and reporting the problems, but also in testing the bug fixes prior to this release.


V3.5.1 (19)
Fixes bug in GPanel constructor without text parameter

Fixes bug that alters font metrics in text controls on first use of setText

Fixes bug in GTextField and GTextArea gains focus from mouse press and the text is a single space it will be selected and so replaced on first keypress.


V3.5 (18)
New control for entering password (GPassword)

Support for displaying UTF8 characters added to GTextField and GTextArea controls

Improved text rendering for controls with transparent background i.e. labels, sliders, radio buttons and checkboxes.

GGroup objects allow controls to be grouped for common tasks e.g. enabling, visibility, transparency and fading. Group actions can executed immediately to after a user defined delay.

GTextField & GTextArea - the setDefaultText method has been deprecated in favour of the setPromptText to make its purpose clearer.

GTextArea - addStyle(...) methods added to set the text style of part or all of a display line. 

GTextArea - insertText(...) methods added to insert text at a specified display line number/character position or at the current caret position.
 
GTextArea - getCaretPos(...) methods added to retrieve the current caret position. 

GImageToggleButton - the stateValue methods have been deprecated in favour of setState(...) and getState() methods.

GDropList - it is now possible to remove, insert and add items to the control at runtime.

GLabel, GButtom, GOption and GCheckbox - new method setHeightToFit() to change the controls height so it just surrounds the text and icon.
